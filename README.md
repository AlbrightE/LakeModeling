# Lake Modeling in R or Python
<a href="url"><img src="Figs/mendota.gif" align="right" height="220" width="220" ></a>

Collection of scripts to simulate heat transport as well as reactive transport in aquatic ecosystems.

## To do 
- ~~add BC to 1D heat transport, i.e., meteorological driver data~~
- check numerical stabilities
- more advanced turbulence closure scheme for 1D heat transport
- coupling to reactive biogeochemical processes
  - dissolved oxygen
  - nutrient
  - light
  - phytoplankton biomass
- experimental: microscale closure scheme
- experimental: individual-based modeling of phytoplankton
- 2D advective-diffusive heat transport
